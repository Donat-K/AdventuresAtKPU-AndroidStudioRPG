- game loop inside of RunningGameState
- most logic is handled inside of the school/home/runningGame action controllers
- all the game data used for processing is inside of PlayerCharacter
  - all the variables in PC are public, so the controllers can read/write easily
  
  - input is keyboard I/O for testing, but is easily ported to any GUI by linking GUI event handler methods with a simple data object
    - View interface has an abstract mnethod for defining how the client builds the UserInput object
    - user inputs need to create a UserInput object, which is a simple data object that your GUI events can create
      and pass to currentController.processPlayerAction(userInput) inside the runningGameState runStateLoop() method
    - the data needed for views needs to be wrapped up in a View object.
     - how android handles updating the GUI may require me to change the View code, depending what data is passed from the main 
       application. i can figure it out.
      
   - TODO:
    - finish and test game logic, including character courses
    - simplify/wrap game logic with enumerated types for easier modification
    - port to android GUI
